## 📖 Abstract

As large language models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents, most existing defense mechanisms adopt a **mandatory checking paradigm**, which forcibly triggers security validation at predefined stages regardless of actual risk. This approach leads to high latency and computational redundancy.

We propose **Spider-Sense**, an event-driven defense framework based on **Intrinsic Risk Sensing (IRS)**. It allows agents to maintain **latent vigilance** and trigger defenses only upon risk perception. Once triggered, Spider-Sense invokes a **Hierarchical Adaptive Screening (HAS)** mechanism that trades off efficiency and precision: resolving known patterns via lightweight similarity matching while escalating ambiguous cases to deep internal reasoning.

---

## ⚡ Framework Comparison

### The Problem: Mandatory Checking

Existing frameworks rely on forced, repetitive external security checks at every stage (Plan, Action, Observation), leading to rapidly accumulating latency and disrupting normal user interaction.

<!-- [Insert Figure 1 Here: Comparison between the Existing Framework and the Spider-Sense Framework] -->

<div align="center">
<img src="images/fig1_process (1).png" alt="Framework Comparison" width="800px" />
</div>

### The Solution: Intrinsic Risk Sensing (IRS)

Spider-Sense utilizes **proactive, endogenous risk awareness** to dynamically trigger targeted analysis only when anomalies are sensed, significantly reducing overhead.

## 🔬 Method Overview

<!-- [Insert Figure 2 Here: Overview of Spider-Sense Framework] -->

<div align="center">
<img src="images/fig2_21.png" alt="Framework Overview" width="900px" />
</div>

The framework operates on a **Detect-Audit-Respond** cycle:

1. **Intrinsic Risk Sensing (IRS)**: The agent maintains a latent state of vigilance. It continuously monitors artifacts across four stages (Query, Plan, Action, Observation).
2. **Sensing Indicator**: Upon perceiving a risk, the agent generates a specific indicator (e.g., `<|verify_user_intent|>`), pausing execution.
3. **Hierarchical Adaptive Screening (HAS)**:
   * **Coarse-grained Detection**: Fast vector matching against a database of known attack patterns.
   * **Fine-grained Analysis**: Deep reasoning by an LLM for ambiguous or low-similarity cases.
4. **Autonomous Decision**: The agent decides to **Resume** execution (if safe) or **Refuse/Sanitize** (if unsafe).

## 🛡️ Defense Modules

Spider-Sense protects four security-critical stages using specialized defense tags:

| Stage                 | Module Tag                      | Function                               | Trigger Condition                                                 |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Query**       | `<\|verify_user_intent\|>`      | **Agent Logic Hijacking**        | When user input attempts to jailbreak or override instructions.   |
| **Plan**        | `<\|validate_memory_plan\|>`    | **Thought-Process Manipulation** | When reasoning or retrieved memories show signs of poisoning.     |
| **Action**      | `<\|audit_action_parameters\|>` | **Tool-Use Exploitation**        | Before executing high-risk tools with suspicious parameters.      |
| **Observation** | `<\|sanitize_observation\|>`    | **Indirect Prompt Injection**    | Upon receiving tool outputs containing hidden malicious commands. |

---

## 📊 S<sup>2</sup>Bench

To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce **S<sup>2</sup>Bench**, a lifecycle-aware benchmark featuring:

* **Multi-stage Attacks**: Covers Query, Plan, Action, and Observation stages.
* **Realistic Tool Execution**: Involves actual tool selection and parameter generation (approx. 300 functions).
* **Hard Benign Prompts**: Includes 153 carefully constructed benign samples to test for over-defense (False Positives).

---

## 📈 Performance Results

Spider-Sense achieves state-of-the-art defense performance with minimal latency on **S2Bench**, **Mind2Web**, and **eICU**.

<!-- [Insert Table 2 or 3 Here: Main Performance Results] -->

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/table2.png" alt="Table 2" width="600px" />
</div>

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/table3.png" alt="Table 3" width="600px" />
</div>

* **Lowest Attack Success Rate (ASR)**: Effectively blocks sophisticated multi-stage attacks.
* **Lowest False Positive Rate (FPR)**: Distinguishes subtle benign intents from attacks.
* **Marginal Latency Overhead**: Only **~8.3%**, compared to >200% for some mandatory checking baselines.

### Ablation Studies

<!-- [Insert Figure 3 & 4 Here: Ablation Study on IRS and HAS] -->

<img src="images/fig4_thinking_ablation.png" alt="Ablation Study 2" width="400px" />
</div>

* **IRS Importance**: Removing sensing at any stage leads to significant ASR proliferation, especially at the Action stage.
* **HAS Balance**: Combining coarse detection and fine analysis yields the best trade-off between safety and efficiency.

## 🔍 Case Study

**Scenario**: A clinical analysis agent retrieving patient records via a utility tool.

<!-- [Insert Figure 5 Here: Case Study of Clinical Agent Interception] -->

<div align="center">
<img src="images/fig5_casestudy_modified2.png" alt="Case Study" width="500px" />
</div>

1. **Attack**: The tool return content is poisoned with injected code `import fake_module` to induce unauthorized execution.
2. **Detection**: The agent's IRS activates the sensing indicator `<|sanitize_observation|>`.
3. **HAS Screening**: The content is routed to the inspector. It is identified as contextually unjustified.
4. **Response**: The agent autonomously terminates execution, intercepting the attack.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/SpiderSense.git
cd SpiderSense
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configuration

Set up your API keys. We recommend using **OpenRouter** for broad model support.

```bash
# Create .env file
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### 3. Run Defense Test

Enable **Intrinsic Risk Sensing** (IRS) using the defense template:

```bash
python main_attacker.py \
    --llm_name qwen-max \
    --defense_template template/spider_template.txt \
    --template_position system \
    --res_file results/spider_sense_test.csv
```
